  title: IBM Watson IoT Platform Delete a draft physical interface
  description: |-
    Deletes the draft physical interface with the specified id from the
    organization in the Watson IoT Platform.

    Please note the the delete will fail if the draft physical interface is
    being referenced  by a device type.

      summary: Query active phyiscal interfaces
      description: |-
        Physical interfaces are used to model the interfaces between physical
        devices and the Watson IoT Platform.  A physical interface references
        event types.  Devices that implement a physical interface publish these
        events to the platform.

        The event types are referenced via a mapping that maps an event id to
        the id of an event type.  The event id corresponds to the MQTT topic
        that the event is published to by a device.

        The **physicalinterfaces** endpoint returns the list of all of the
        active physical interfaces that have been defined for the organization
        in the Watson IoT Platform.  Various query parameters can be used to
        filter, sort and page through the list of active physical interfaces
        that are returned.
